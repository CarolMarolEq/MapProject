# MapProject
This project served to showcase asyncronous code- visualized in a map that shows multiple stops in a sequence that lead from MIT to Harvard.

I would like to build on this skillset by adding features to pin other locations and add stops by request. I think this would be a useful and more dynamic addition to the map.
